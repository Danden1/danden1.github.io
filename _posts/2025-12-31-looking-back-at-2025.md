This year, I became comfortable using AI agents in my daily work.

## Copilot PoC at My Company

Earlier this year, I participated in a company-wide Copilot PoC, which involved around 40 employees across the organization.
I was able to take part in this project thanks to my team lead’s recommendation.

## Backend Engineering Fundamentals

I developed a logging library to comply with Korean GIS-related regulations.
During this process, I gained a deeper understanding of asynchronous processing.

I became interested in data consistency and started studying Kafka, MongoDB, and Redis.
I realized that these technologies share many underlying concepts, which helped me understand why strong computer science fundamentals are so important.

This year, I was also able to contribute to open source.
Rather than simply using open-source software, I started thinking, “It would be great if this feature were supported.”
That mindset led me to contribute to the ShedLock project.

## Applying AI in Practice

Applying AI in Practice

In addition, I worked on improving team productivity by using AI and n8n.
Examples include service history summarization, ticket root-cause analysis with alerts, and resource trend analysis.
Through these efforts, I learned how to use AI effectively in real-world workflows.

When dealing with service issues, I often asked AI for help and was able to resolve problems more efficiently.
Rather than accepting the answers blindly, I reviewed the actual code myself to evaluate the suggestions critically.

As a result of these efforts, I was selected as the second top performer within my business division.

Currently, I am implementing an AI agent at my company.
I am studying various AI-related topics such as context engineering with ACE, A2A communication, and how to select the most suitable agent in an A2A environment.
These approaches help reduce human error and eliminate repetitive, tedious tasks.

External Activities and Side Projects

As a side project, I am developing an education platform.
At my current job, I have learned a lot about handling large-scale traffic, but the business logic is relatively simple and mostly focused on delivering JSON responses.

Through this side project, I have been able to explore new challenges and learn a great deal.
I learned about Server-Sent Events (SSE) for notifications, and through that process, I also gained an understanding of Spring’s @TransactionalEventListener.
(Of course, additional logic is required to properly handle data consistency and retries.)

## Conclusion

This year was truly the year of AI.

I learned that when something feels inconvenient, it is important to dig deeper.
In many cases, similar logic can be applied and reused in other systems and contexts.

Beyond internal company work, I also learned a great deal through external activities, including exposure to different domains and collaboration styles.
I strongly recommend participating in external activities whenever possible.
